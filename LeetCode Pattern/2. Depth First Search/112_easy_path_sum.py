'''
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has 
a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.
A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0
Output: false
 
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

  MY CODE VERSION
  Thought:
    Follow in template of path search (root-leaf):
      - closure variable: result that if has a path as required
      - base case: no node exist
      - condition: if leaf value equals to the current remaining
      - recursion: carry out the target sum minus current value
  Complexity:
    Time: O(n) for visiting of each node
    Space: O(H) H is the height of the tree. expense for recursion stack. average O(logn)

          ### 在JavaScript中则可直接对函数外层定义的ifHasPath进行更新
