'''
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, 
return all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals targetSum.
A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0
Output: []
 
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

  MY CODE VERSION
  Thought:
    Same thought as 112. Use a closure 'path' variable to record the current path
    Two keys things to remind:
      1. we need to append a copy of 'path' to the result
      2. we need to pop() path after returning from current recursion
  Complexity:
    Time: O(n) for visiting of each node
    Space: O(H) H is the height of the tree. expense for recursion stack. average O(logn)
