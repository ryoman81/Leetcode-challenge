'''
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. 
A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

Example 2:
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
 
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

    Different from 112, 113, 124. The path may not be root-to-leaf, neither top-to-bottom
    A recursive concept should be understood. At a single node, 
        A
      /   \
     B     C
      - The paths could be A->B, A->C, or B->A->C
      - A key point is to record a so-called 'max-gain' at each node
      - We record this gain to the result if this gain is larger than others 
  Complexity:
    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(H)
