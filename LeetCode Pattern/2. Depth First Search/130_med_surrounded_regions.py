'''
Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example 1:
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. 
Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. 
Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

Example 2:
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
 
Constraints:
m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.

  MY CODE VERSION
  Thought:
    1. We first iterate all border element
      - if meet a 'O', we start DFS and tag all connected 'O' to a temporary 'Y' (tag step)
    2. After checking all border elements and converted all border connected 'O' to 'Y'
      - We iterate all element and convert all remaining 'O' to 'X' (flip step)
      - We also restore all tagged 'Y' back to 'O'
  Complexity:
    Time: O(nm)
    Space: O(nm) stack space expense for recursion
