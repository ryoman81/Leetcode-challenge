/**
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction, design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
